## Overview

Many customers have been asking for a seamless way to send messages and notifications to agents directly within our platform. In response, I designed an app that enables supervisors to broadcast messages to all agents or target specific queue members with ease. 
The app is fully embedded in Dynamics 365 and accessible through the Admin Center. It leverages the platform's native notification components, ensuring zero disruption to any existing messaging workflows already in use. Also, the dashboard section shows all the agents that have acknowledged the notification and the ones still missing.
And of course, if you know me, great functionality isn't enough. The app also delivers a modern, intuitive UI for both agents and supervisors, making communication not just efficient, but enjoyable.

The solution is fully portable — no hardcoded environment values. All API calls use relative OData paths and the org URL is resolved at runtime via `Xrm.Utility.getGlobalContext().getClientUrl()`.

1. **Supervisor creates a notification** in the Notification Center (draft, scheduled, or immediate send)
2. **On send**, the system creates native D365 `appnotification` records for all target users (or queue members), each with a "View Details" action
3. **NotificationPoller.js** runs on every form load across D365, polling the Dataverse every 15 seconds for unacknowledged notifications
4. **Agents see a global banner** at the top of any D365 page. Clicking "View Details" opens the rich notification popup
5. **Agent acknowledges** — an ack record is created with a timestamp, and the supervisor can track this in the Reports tab

### Creating Notifications

1. Click **+ New Notification** to open the compose modal
2. Fill in **Title** and **Message** (required)
3. Optionally configure:
   - **Category** — select from your custom categories
   - **Priority** — Normal, Important, or Urgent
   - **Target Queue** — search and select specific queues, or leave empty to broadcast to everyone
   - **Image** — paste a URL or drag-and-drop upload (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG up to 5MB — uploaded as a D365 web resource)
   - **Link** — add a URL with custom button text
4. Choose an action:

   - **Schedule** — pick a future date/time and timezone
   - **Preview** — see how agents will see it
   - **Send Now** — deliver immediately via native D365 in-app notifications + global banners

Additional actions on existing notifications:
- **Edit** or **Delete** drafts
- **Send Now** or **Cancel** scheduled notifications
- **View Details** or **Clone** sent notifications

### Managing Categories

1. Go to the **Categories** tab
2. Click **+ New Category**
3. Set a **name**, pick an **emoji** (from the grid or type your own), choose a **color** (presets or custom picker), and add an optional **description**
4. Categories appear as colored badges with emoji on notifications throughout the app

### Reports & Analytics

1. Go to the **Reports** tab
2. Filter by date range using the From/To inputs
3. View **KPI cards**: Total Sent, Scheduled, Drafts, Acknowledgments, and Total Notifications
4. Analyze the **Acknowledgment Rate Chart** — horizontal bars color-coded by rate (green ≥80%, orange 50–79%, red <50%). Click any bar to drill down
5. Review the **Acknowledgments Over Time** chart — stacked daily view of sent vs. acknowledged
6. Browse the **notification card list** — click any card to drill down into:
   - Acknowledged vs. Pending agent counts
   - Acknowledgment timeline chart (hourly breakdown)
   - Searchable agent lists showing who acknowledged and who hasn't

## Agent Experience

When a notification is sent, agents see it in two ways:

1. **Native D365 in-app notification toast** — appears in the D365 notification bell. Priority maps to notification severity (Info, Warning, Error)
2. **Global banner** — a colored banner at the top of any D365 page, shown by the poller. Urgent notifications appear as red error-level banners, Important as yellow warnings

Clicking **"View Details"** on either opens a styled popup dialog showing:
- Category badge and priority indicator
- Full message with preserved formatting
- Attached image (if any)
- Action link button (if any)
- **Acknowledge** button — creates a timestamped ack record and shows a success confirmation

The poller deduplicates notifications using both `window.top` memory and `localStorage`, so agents won't see the same notification banner twice even after navigating between pages.

- ✅ Dynamic base URL via `Xrm.Utility.getGlobalContext()`
- ✅ Entity schema names are consistent across environments
- ✅ All API calls use relative OData paths

To export, use the standard D365 solution export process.
